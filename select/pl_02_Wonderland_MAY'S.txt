Tell me you love me baby.
I've got this world to show you
You can leave everything you got behind
We don't need a plane to get there
`Cause I got this glow inside me
But its only shining when you're around
All that you want is waiting
I know which path to get there
Follow white rabbit and unlock the door
You won't be without me baby
`Cause I've got this flow about me
But I'm only gliding when you're around
`Cause we've got flowers everywhere
Caterpillars over there
All you need
Just make a wish
Now just close your eyes
You're living now in Wonderland
You're living now in Wonderland
When we collided baby
I knew a star was shining
We didn't even leave a single piece behind
We don't need to take a picture
`Cause I've got this brush inside me
I could paint a rose any style ya like
Tell me you love me baby
`Cause this is my world to show you
We can have a Tea time anytime you like
All you need is love to be here
Royal Heart`s will kneel before you
Fairytales are made so that YOU come to life
`Cause we've got mountains high up there
Miles of oceans over there
All you need, just make a wish
now just close your eyes
You're living now in wonderland
Can forget Tweedle Dee Tweedle Dum
Mad hatter
